# open_learning
Being wrong on the internet.

## Intro
This is my attempt at learning stuff out in the open. I've been coding for a while, but it's only recently become a major part of my actual job. My goal is to update to this repo somewhat consitently and not get too hung up on getting it right the first time. If you happen upon this and want to drop some advice or share something cool, please do.
